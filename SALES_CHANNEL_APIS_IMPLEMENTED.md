# Sales Channel APIs Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ All Critical APIs Implemented

### 1. ProductListing API ‚úÖ

**Purpose**: Manage which products are published to Paya Marketplace sales channel

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/integrations/shopify/product-listings`
  - Fetch all product listings
  - Shows published/unpublished status
  
- `POST /api/integrations/shopify/product-listings/:product_id`
  - Publish a product to Paya Marketplace
  - Makes product available on sales channel
  
- `DELETE /api/integrations/shopify/product-listings/:product_id`
  - Unpublish a product from Paya Marketplace
  - Removes product from sales channel

**Required Scopes:**
- `read_product_listings`
- `write_product_listings`

---

### 2. Sales Attribution API ‚úÖ

**Purpose**: Track sales that originate from Paya Marketplace back to Shopify

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/integrations/shopify/orders/:order_id/attribution`
  - Attribute an order to Paya Marketplace
  - Tracks source_name, referring_site, landing_site
  - Adds channel metadata to orders
  
- `POST /api/integrations/shopify/checkouts/attribution`
  - Track checkout attribution
  - Records sales channel in checkout notes
  
- `GET /api/integrations/shopify/sales-analytics`
  - Get sales analytics for Paya Marketplace
  - Calculate total revenue from channel
  - Count orders from channel
  - Filter orders by sales channel

**How It Works:**
- When a sale is made on Paya Marketplace, call the attribution endpoint
- Order is tagged with `source_name: 'Paya Marketplace'`
- Shopify analytics will show sales attributed to your channel
- Merchants can see which sales came from Paya

**Required Scopes:**
- `read_only_own_orders` (already added)

### 3. ResourceFeedback API ‚úÖ

**Purpose**: Communicate issues, errors, and eligibility problems to merchants

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/integrations/shopify/resource-feedback`
  - Create general feedback for a product
  - States: `success`, `requires_action`, `failure`
  
- `POST /api/integrations/shopify/products/:product_id/feedback/eligibility`
  - Communicate eligibility issues
  - Example: "Product price too low for Paya", "Missing required images"
  
- `POST /api/integrations/shopify/products/:product_id/feedback/error`
  - Communicate publishing errors
  - Example: "Failed to sync inventory", "API connection error"

**Feedback States:**
- `success` - Product published successfully
- `requires_action` - Merchant needs to fix something
- `failure` - Publishing failed

**Use Cases:**
1. Product doesn't meet marketplace requirements
2. Publishing failed due to API error
3. Product needs merchant attention
4. Inventory sync issues

## üîÑ How These APIs Work Together

### Product Publishing Flow:
1. Merchant imports products from Shopify
2. Products are stored in Paya database
3. Use **ProductListing API** to publish selected products to Paya Marketplace
4. Use **ResourceFeedback API** to communicate any issues

### Sales Flow:
1. Customer buys product on Paya Marketplace
2. Order is created in Paya system
3. Use **Sales Attribution API** to attribute sale to Paya channel
4. Shopify tracks revenue from your sales channel
5. Merchant sees analytics in Shopify admin

### Error Handling Flow:
1. Product fails to publish (e.g., missing images)
2. Use **ResourceFeedback API** to notify merchant
3. Merchant sees feedback in Shopify admin
4. Merchant fixes issue
5. Product can be republished
